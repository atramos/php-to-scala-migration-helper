#summary Release Notes for the PHP-to-Scala Migration Helper
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Basically, the Hello World test works right now; a more complex test (computation of digits of PI - from the Computer Benchmarks Game) converts from PHP to Scala correctly in terms of syntax, but the run-time is still buggy so it crashes with an Exception.

==New Features in v0.3 (2010-04-18 download)==
 * The Quercus run-time has been integrated, i.e. initialized and functions with the proper signatures are available to subclasses of php.script
 * Simplified the syntax (eg. use call() and function() instead of apply() and ->() for now) to try to debug issues with the php.scala run-time

==New Features in v0.2==
 * Begun integration with the Quercus run-time (full PHP library implementation in Java)
 * Right now everything compiles fine but only test_0.php (Hello World) runs successfully
 * Successful compilation of test_1.scala!!! It still doesn't run, as the Quercus integration is unfinished
 * The conversion of constructors now is nice and clean, although not "idiomatic Scala"
 * Renamed php.value to '$', to identify generic PHP variables.
 * Primitive type-inference (everything is a '$', but at least it is declared)
 * Implemented implicit conversions in php.scala
 * Improved type inference - variables assigned to an integer are declared var:Int

==Features implemented in v0.1==
 * Use the built-in PHP tokenizer for correctness (should handle complex scripts)
 * Recursive "look-ahead" parser avoids an AST, this helps preserve code structure.
 * Breaking up of for(;;) loops into scala while() loops is working.
 * Use correct syntax for function declaration (including no '=' for non-returning)
 * Removal of dollar signs from all variables
 * Change of array index square brackets to parens.
 * Change of object operator -> to '.'
 * Inline HTML for now just invokes an "output" function with triple-quoted string.
 * Correct handling of command-syntax (e.g. print) by adding parenthesis.
 * File scope becomes an object scope; this should help a later "aliasing" scheme.

==TODO ITEMS==
 * The Quercus run-time needs to be integrated. See mklib.sh, phplib.java, and php.scala for work already done.
 * Simple type inference based on function type-hints.
